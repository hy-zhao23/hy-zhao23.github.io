I am a second-year graduate student at the [Department of Computer Science, New Jersey Institue of Technology(NJIT)](https://cs.njit.edu). Currently, I am working closely with [Prof. Mengnan Du](https://mengnandu.com) on model interpretablity. My research interests lie in Explainable AI(XAI), with an emphasis on large language models(LLMs).
