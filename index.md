## About Me

I am a first-year graduate student at the [Department of Computer Science, New Jersey Institue of Technology(NJIT)](https://cs.njit.edu). Currently, I am working closely with [Prof. Mengnan Du](https://mengnandu.com) on model interpretablity. My research interests lie in Explainable AI(XAI), with an emphasis on large language models(LLMs). Before that I obtained my master degree from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST)](http://aia.hust.edu.cn) and my bachelor degree from [Wuhan University of Technology(WUT)](http://sa.whut.edu.cn).


## Research Interests

**XAI**, **LLM Alignment**
